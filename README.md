Spotify Foundation
=========

**Note:** This project is no longer active due to Spotify removing the apps feature from their desktop app.

Spotify Foundation is a freely available and open source foundational Spotify App takes resources such as [kitchensink](https://github.com/ptrwtts/kitchensink) by [Peter Watts](http://swarm.fm/) and [Spotify Apps Tutorial](https://github.com/mager/spotify-apps-tutorial) by Andrew Mager and attempts to expand on them.

I will try and give API usage examples that are contained in both apps, but also some more advanced examples such as integrating plugins and real use-case examples of how the API can be used.

This app also serves as a small example of how to organise your app. It includes a nice use of namespacing, memory management, [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com/), [jQuery UI](http://www.jqueryui.com/), [templating](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/) and [Script.js](http://github.com/ded/script.js/).

To help drive this app and keep the content expanding please [contact me](https://github.com/mitchmalone) with any and all requests. Please also report any bugs via [Github](https://github.com/mitchmalone/foundation/issues), but remember this app is only a demo so please only report functional bugs.
